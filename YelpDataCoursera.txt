Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 3979
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	No
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT *
	FROM User
	WHERE id IS NULL;
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:5		avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

+------+-------+-------+
SQL code used to arrive at answer: 

SELECT city, stars, COUNT(id) AS count
FROM business
WHERE city == 'Avon'
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT city, stars, COUNT(id) AS count
FROM business
WHERE city == 'Beachwood'
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

+-----------+-------+-------+
| city      | stars | count |
+-----------+-------+-------+
| Beachwood |   5.0 |     5 |
| Beachwood |   3.0 |     2 |
| Beachwood |   3.5 |     2 |

| Beachwood |   2.5 |     1 |
| Beachwood |   4.0 |     1 |
+-----------+-------+-------+

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT name, review_count
FROM user
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		
+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
No, this is because it seems there is no direct relationship between the number of reviews
and the no of fans. For example, review count of 2000, and a review count of 978 has 497 fans.
With this insight, we can conclude that there is direct causation between the two attributes.


9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:Yes

+------------+------------+
| love_count | hate_count |
+------------+------------+
|       1780 |        232 |
+------------+------------+
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT (SELECT Count(text)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%love%") As love_count
, (SELECT count(text) 
   FROM review
   WHERE text like "%hate%") As hate_count
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
SELECT name, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |
| Cat       |  133 |
| William   |  126 |
| Fran      |  124 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, there seems to be different distribution for restaurants across different cities. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
  
Yes, there seems to be different number of reviews for different restaurants cross cities.        
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No, I do not see any relevance of the location data in how restaurants are reviewed across cities

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT b.name, b.city, b.stars, h.hours

i. Difference 1: Opened business has an overall star rating of 4.0 with a frequency of 574. 
This also means there are 574 opened businesses across cities
         
         
ii. Difference 2: Closed business has an overall star rating of 4.5 with a frequency of 122. 
This equally means there are 122 closed business across cities.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: 

Comparing overall star ratings across top 3 opened businesses 

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        
For this analysis, I have selected only opened businesses, and the relevant variables include overall star rating, 
category of business, and the overall review count. 

From the analysis, names of the top 3 businesses are Big Wong restaurant, West Side Market, and Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse. All three 
falls under consumable categories.
